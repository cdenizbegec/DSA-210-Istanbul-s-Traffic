# DSA 210 Term Project: The Effect of Daily Precipitation on Istanbul's Traffic Index
## Objective
This project aims to analyze the daily relationship between precipitation and traffic density in Istanbul over a two year period (September 2022 to September 2024).
The goal is to determine if and to what extent increased precipitation leads to a higher traffic index.
### Hyphothesis: 
There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the daily total precipitation amount and the average daily traffic index.
## Motivation
Traffic congestion is one of the most critical urban challenges in large metropolitan cities.
It is one of the biggest problems in Istanbul, a city where millions of people travel daily between two continents.
Istanbul experiences high vehicle density, long commuting times, and variable traffic conditions influenced by multiple factors.
Weather is one of these factors. Precipitation, in particular, can reduce visibility, worsen road conditions, and cause drivers to slow down or change lanes more frequently. 
All of these often lead to longer travel times, more frequent accidents, and increased congestion.
This project seeks to quantify the impact of daily rainfall on traffic slowdowns by examining two years of data. 
The findings could help the city planners, local authorities, and app developers to create more effective traffic management strategies and smarter mobility solutions.
## Datasets
In this project publicly available datasets will be used.
### 1.Weather Data
Daily precipitation data will be used from September 2022 to September 2024. Location will be set as Istanbul, Turkey. This data will be sourced from Open-Meteo API.
### 2.Traffic Data
Daily average traffic index of Istanbul will be used from September 2022 to September 2024. This data will be sourced from İBB Open Data Portal.
## Data Collection Plan
**1.** Retrieve daily weather data using the Open-Meteo API.

**2.** Collect daily traffic index data from the İBB Open Data Portal for the same period.

**3.** Clean and align both datasets using consistent date formats.

**4.** Merge datasets by date to enable analysis.
