# DSA 210 Term Project: The Effect of Daily Precipitation on Istanbul's Traffic Index
## Objective
This project aims to analyze the daily relationship between rainfall and traffic density in Istanbul over a two-year period (September 2022 to September 2024).
The goal is to determine whether increased precipitation leads to higher traffic congestion, and to what extent rainfall influences daily traffic patterns.
### Hyphothesis: 
There is a statistically significant positive correlation between the daily total precipitation amount and the average daily traffic index.
## Motivation
Traffic congestion is one of the most critical urban challenges in large metropolitan cities.
It is one of the biggest problems in Istanbul, a city where millions of people travel daily between two continents.
Istanbul experiences high vehicle density, long commuting times, and variable traffic conditions influenced by multiple factors.
Weather is one of these factors. Precipitation, in particular, reduces visibility, affects road conditions, and causes drivers to slow down or drive more cautiously. 
These changes often lead to longer travel times, more frequent accidents, and overall higher congestion levels.
By analyzing two years of data, this project aims to understand how much daily precipitation contributes to traffic slowdowns.
The findings could help local authorities, transport planners, and app developers design better traffic management strategies and smarter mobility tools.
## Datasets
In this project publicly available datasets will be used.
### 1.Weather Data
This data will be sourced from Open-Meteo Historical Weather API with the location of Istanbul, Turkey from September 2022 to September 2024 with daily frequency.
### 2.Traffic Data
This data will be sourced from Ä°BB Open Data Portal between September 2022 and September 2024 daily.
